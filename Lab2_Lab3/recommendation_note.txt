# Three types of recommender system--
 1. Content based : if I see a romantic song then youtube will suggest me the next song also romantic song.
 2. collaboratory filtering based : If user A and B see a same movie like 3 idiots then if A see a another movie like pushpa then youtube automatically suggest the pushpa movie of the user B.
 3. Hybrid : The system maintain the both recommendation system.

# We will implement the content based recommendation system.
